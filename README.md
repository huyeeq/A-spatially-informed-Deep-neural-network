# A-spatially-informed-Deep-neural-network

This repository contains the Python codes (.py files) developed in PyTorch for the paper: "A spatially-informed interpretable deep learning framework for high-resolution nutrient monitoring in complex coastal waters".  

The code provides the implementation of the deep learning model and the associated analysis tools discussed in the manuscript.  

### Code Description
**Deep neural network.py:** This script contains the core implementation of the spatially-informed deep neural network (DNN) model. It includes the model architecture, training loop, and validation procedures.  
**Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).py:** This script implements the Kernel Density Estimation analysis, which is a key component of the model's interpretability framework as described in the paper.

### Requirements
The code is written in Python 3. The major dependencies include:   
PyTorch  
NumPy  
Pandas  
Scikit-learn  
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)  

### Usage
**Data Preparation:** Ensure your input data is preprocessed and formatted as described in the methodology section of the paper.  
**Configuration:** Open the .py scripts to adjust parameters such as data paths, model hyperparameters, and training settings as needed.  
**Execution:** Run the main model script from your terminal.
